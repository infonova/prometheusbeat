# Prometheusbeat

Prometheusbeat is an elastic [beat](https://www.elastic.co/products/beats) that can receive Prometheus metrics via the remote write feature.

Example Prometheusbeat configuration:

```
prometheusbeat:
  listen: ":8080"
  context: "/prometheus"

[...]
```

Example Prometheus configuration:

```
[...]

remote_write:
  url: "http://localhost:8080/prometheus"

[...]
```

Example Prometheusbeat event:

```
{
  "@timestamp": "2018-09-28T11:44:07.006Z",
  "@metadata": {
    "beat": "prometheusbeat",
    "type": "doc",
    "version": "6.4.1"

docker build . -t infonova/prometheusbeat:latest
```

## Running Docker Image

Prometheusbeat Docker image can be run using below command

```
docker run -itd  --name prometheusbeat -p <<dockerhost-port>>:8080 -v <<host-config-path>>:/home/prometheusbeat-config/prometheusbeat.yml infonova/prometheusbeat
```
